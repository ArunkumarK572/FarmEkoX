## Project Overview
Small and marginal farmers often rely on traditional practices or local advice for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. This leads to suboptimal yields, higher input costs, and environmental harm. The Smart Crop Advisory System (FarmEkoX) provides a unified, mobile-first solution delivering personalized, localized, and accessible crop advisory services using real-time data, rule-based logic, and AI-driven assistance in local languages.

---

## Problem Statement
Many small and marginal farmers lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather, and crop history. Barriers include language, low digital literacy, and the absence of localized tools. This leads to poor yields, overuse of chemicals, and higher costs.

## Objectives
- Easy Registration: Simple, farmer-friendly sign-up with minimal digital skills required.  
- Season-wise Crop Recommendation: Intelligent recommendations accounting for season, location, and climate.  
- Crop Calendar View: Guidance on sowing, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting schedules.  
- 7-Day Local Weather Forecast: Location-specific short-term forecasts for planning.  
- Rain Alerts – Skip Irrigation: Notifications about upcoming rainfall to conserve water.  
- Fertilizer Dose Calculator: Barcode-based fertilizer identification to determine nutrient composition and correct dosing.  
- Today’s News and Mandi Prices: Real-time agricultural news and mandi (market) price updates.  
- AI Voice and Chat Advisory in Local Language: Voice/chat assistant supporting local languages for accessibility.  
- Ask Expert Button: Direct connection to agricultural experts for personalized advice.  
- Nearby Resources Locator: Locate seed stores, fertilizer shops, mandis, and other resources via location services.  
- Multi-Language Interface: Support for regional languages to ensure inclusivity.

---

## Background & Related Work
- Existing apps such as Plantix, AgriApp, and IFFCO Kisan provide crop information, weather updates, and basic advisories.  
- Research and deployments show machine learning and AI can drive crop recommendation and fertilizer planning, but many tools lack deep localization, voice support, or precision fertilizer tooling.  
- There is a need for an integrated platform tailored for small and marginal farmers combining advisory, market information, fertilizer precision, and accessible AI voice/chat in local languages.

## Proposed Methodology
The methodology is an integrated approach combining real-time data, domain rules, and AI-driven assistance delivered via a mobile application.

Workflow:
1. User Access: Easy registration with profile and location capture.  
2. Input Data Collection: Season, crop, land area, weather, and fertilizer details (barcode scan).  
3. Processing & Advisory Logic: Analyze inputs to produce crop recommendations, fertilizer dosage, irrigation advice, and alerts.  
4. AI Advisory Support: Voice and chat assistant delivers localized, personalized guidance.  
5. Expert & Resource Support: In-app option to consult experts and locate nearby resources.  
6. Market & Update Services: Real-time mandi prices and agricultural news for decision support.

## Software Requirements
- Mobile Application (Frontend): React Native or Flutter for responsive, multi-language mobile UI.  
- Backend Server: Node.js for server-side logic, APIs, and authentication.  
- Database: MongoDB / Cloud database for storing user profiles, crop/fertilizer data, and history.  
- AI Voice Assistant Module: Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech in local languages for voice advisory.  
- Barcode Scanning Module: Mobile camera + barcode libraries to identify fertilizers and fetch nutrient data.  
- APIs/Services: Weather API, market price feeds (e.g., e-NAM), and news feeds.

---

## Innovation & Contribution
- AI Voice Assistant: Local language voice advisory for farmers with low literacy.  
- Barcode Fertilizer Calculator: Scan fertilizers to auto-identify composition and calculate dose.  
- Smart Irrigation Alerts: Rain forecasting to skip unnecessary irrigation and conserve water.  
- Integrated Advisory Platform: Crop advisories, fertilizer management, market information, and expert contact in one app.  
- Farmer-Friendly Interface: Simple, multi-language UI optimized for small and marginal farmers.
